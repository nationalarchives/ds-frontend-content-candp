      <p class="s_titlesm">Did the Industrial Revolution lead to more crime?</p>
      <p class="s_defaultital">The BIG QUESTION in this Strand is about how much 
        crime has changed over the centuries. One of the big factors affecting 
        crime is the economy of the country: what work do people do, and where? 
        Who is rich and who is not?</p>
      <p class="s_default">During the period covered by this Gallery, Britain 
        went through some extraordinary changes. The population rose from 10 million 
        in 1750 to 42 million in 1900. In 1750 most of these people lived in villages 
        in the countryside; by 1900 most of the British people lived in towns 
        and cities. London was the only great city in Britain in 1750, with a 
        population of 2/3 of a million people; this rose to over 3 million by 
        1900. But other places, small rural towns or even villages in 1750 had 
        become cities by 1900. For example, Liverpool's population rose from 22,000 
        to 450,000; Manchester's from 18,000 to 376,000; Preston's from 5,000 
        to 92,000, and so on. <br>
        For many people, life in these new cities was tough. They lived in over-crowded, 
        squalid housing. Disease was common. But they were also more free than 
        they had been in the village, where their employer also owned their home 
        and always knew what they were up to.<br>
        These cities grew up because of industry. In textiles, iron, metal goods 
        and pottery, production moved to large scale factory methods. Instead 
        of a skilled worker making items on a small scale, factories used machines, 
        powered by water or steam engines, employing a huge work force of semi-skilled 
        or unskilled workers to manufacture on a large scale. Working conditions 
        were often unsafe, and employment was uncertain, but some industrialists 
        grew rich, rivalling the wealth and power of the older landowning classes.<br>
        The Industrial Revolution meant that far more goods, of all kinds, were 
        being made, moved about, and sold. The transport system changed radically 
        to meet the new demands. First stage-coaches supplied faster travel than 
        ever before, then, from the 1770s, canals provided an entirely new, cheap, 
        bulk transport system. From 1840 the railways supplanted both, with 23,000 
        miles of track in Britain by 1900, providing fast, cheap transport for 
        passengers and freight.<br>
        So how did these dramatic changes to the face of Britain affect crime? 
        Was there more crime, or less? Were there different crimes? And what did 
        people at the time think was going on?<br>
        In the Case-Studies in this Gallery of the Crime Strand you will find 
        examples of real crimes committed in this period. You will see how the 
        government began to collect and analyse crime statistics and understand 
        some of the problems involved in doing this. You will also see that people 
        at the time thought and argued about changes in crime.</p>
