      <p class="s_titlesm">Did Governments in this period decide what kinds of
        people were to be regarded as criminals?</p>
      <p><i><span class="s_defaultital">The BIG QUESTION in this Strand is about 
        how much crime has changed over the centuries. One of the big factors 
        affecting crime is the attitude of the government. Because they pass the 
        laws, governments can decide what kinds of actions are crimes and what 
        aren't. Sometimes these change: new crimes are created, or old ones abandoned.</span></i><br>
        <br>
        <span class="s_default">In the period covered by this section, England 
        became a more prosperous and, on the whole, more peaceful country. Some 
        people became very well off indeed, as you can tell from the many fine 
        houses they built, still to be seen in our towns and countryside. <br>
        At the same time there were huge tensions in the country. The Reformation 
        brought terrible conflicts between Roman Catholics and Protestants. There 
        was a bloody Civil War from 1642 to 1651. Rising population forced thousands 
        of people into poverty. There were rebellions. The rich and powerful had 
        a lot to lose and felt that some types of people were a threat to them. 
        They used the increased powers of the government to define new crimes 
        - and so turned certain people into criminals.<br>
        </span><span class="s_default"> But did everybody agree with the government's 
        definitions of crime? In the period covered by this section &quot;the 
        government&quot; was not democratically elected. What happened if ordinary 
        people disagreed about who should be treated as a criminal?<br>
        In the Case-Studies in this Gallery of the Crime Strand you will find 
        examples of how the government made certain people criminals, by using 
        the law. At the same time, you will see whether ordinary people agreed 
        with these decisions.</span></p>
      <span class="s_default">Six Case-Studies:<br>
	  1.<a href="g04cs1.htm" class="cplink"></a></span><a href="g04cs1.htm" class="cplink">
	  Vagabonds</a><br>
	  <span class="s_default">2.</span><a href="g04cs2.htm" class="cplink"> Heresy
	  &amp; Treason</a><br>
      <span class="s_default">3. </span><a href="g04cs3.htm" class="cplink">Witchcraft</a><br>
	  4.<a href="g04cs4.htm" class="cplink"> Highwaymen</a><br>
      <span class="s_default">5.</span><a href="g04cs5.htm" class="cplink"> Smuggling</a><br>

      </span>
      <p class="s_default">How To Work<br>
        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the Sources
        in each. There are HINTS in each Case-Study to help you get the most out
        of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of your Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery  Worksheet.<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only be able to answer the
        Key Question when you have done most or all of the Case-Studies. However,
        you could divide the job around the class, sharing your results from different
        versions of the Gallery  Worksheet.</p>
