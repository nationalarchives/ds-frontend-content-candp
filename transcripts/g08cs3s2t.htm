        Constable, who is generally new to his office<br>
        every year, and who has little inclination to<br>
        meddle with characters who he is fearful to of-<br>
        fend, and who may do him some injury in his<br>
        business, either privately by false report, or<br>
        publicly by insult; how is it possible he can<br>
        fearlessly and faithfully do his duty? But,<br>
        should this not be the case, he will not, during<br>
        the short season of his being in office, reap<br>
        much benefit from experience; if he is called <br>
        into action, he is without knowledge how to<br>
        act against a set of men, who, from long prac-<br>
        tice in vice, know well how to use every art and<br>
        every stratagem to elude detection, and instead<br>
        of apprehension for crime, they evade the law,<br>
        until some incautious moment they commit<br>
        themselves and are detected, after a long series<br>
        of plunder on their neighbours and the public,<br>
        when the contrary would, in all probability, be<br>
        the consequence, if a small number of persons<br>
        was selected as permanent Police Officers.</span></p>
