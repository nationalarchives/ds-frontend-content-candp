        Dated: 15 June 1634<br>
        From: Bishop of Chester concerning the witches.<br>
        To the right honourable Sir John Cooke, and Sir Francis Windebank Knights<br>
        Principall Secretaries to his Majestie and Lords of his Majesties honourable

      <p class="s_default">Margaret Johnson widow, aged 60 yeares or theraboutes 
        saide That shee hath beene a Witch<br>
        about 6 yeares last past; and that shee was brought therto, upon some 
        troubles<br>
        and vexations of her badd neighbours; And, about that time walking in 
        the <br>
        highway in Marsden in the parish of Whalley, there appeared to her a Man 
        in<br>
        blacke Attire trussed with blacke pointes, who said to her: If shee would 
        give<br>
        him her soule, shee should want nothinge, but should have power to hurt 
        whom<br>
        shee would both man and beast; but shee then refused and therupon hee 
        vanished.<br>
        In this manner hee oft times resorted to her, till at last shee yeilded 
        to him,<br>
        and hee gave her into her hand some silver and gold (as shee thought) 
        but it<br>
        vanished soone againe, and shee knowes not how: for shee was ever bare 
        and poore<br>
        though hee oft gave her the like. And shee asked his name and hee called<br>
        himselfe Mamilion: &#133;And/ <br>
        after this hee appeared to her in other shapes: as sometimes of a browne 
        coloured<br>
        Dogg; sometimes of a white Catt, and at other times like an hare; and 
        that these <br>
        did sucke her blood at 2 Duggs or papps in her privie partes; one wherof<br>
        is as bigg (shee saith) as her litle Finger, and halfe as long; the other 
        lesse:<br>
        But since shee lay in prison they have shrunke upp and growne lesse then 
        formerly.</p>
