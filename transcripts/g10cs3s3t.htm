      <p> I am thinking in particular of the fact that the present<br>
        rise in the level of juvenile delinquency has taken place<br>
        against a background in which there has been a steady,<br>
        general improvement in many of those conditions that we<br>
        used to regard as having an influence on juvenile delinquency.<br>
        For example,<br>
        Thus, vast numbers of houses have been built since the end<br>
        of the war and there is much less over-crowding than there<br>
        used to be: many more playing fields have been provided:<br>
        many more places for handicapped children have been found<br>
        in residential special schools: and the number of child guidance <br>
        centres and clinics has been increased. <span class="s_default_line_through">At 
        one<br>
        The blame </span>is sometimes put on <span class="s_default_line_through">time 
        we blamed</span> the effects o<span class="s_default_line_through">n</span>f 
        evacuation and other war-time<br>
        disturbances and the artificial values created by scarcities<br>
        during and after the war; but things of that kind, whatever<br>
        originally, things of that kind<br>
        their effect must now be a diminishing factor of much less<br>
        fast diminishing importance. <br>
        We used to believe - and no doubt it was true - that<br>
        a great deal of crime was a by-product of poverty and hunger;<br>
        but I doubt whether there has ever been less poverty and less<br>
        More recently<br>
        hunger than now. Indeed I have heard it put forward - <br>
        there may well be<br>
        recently and I am sure there is a great deal of truth in<br>
        is a by-product<br>
        it - that much of the juvenile delinquency today can be<br>
        of unaccustomed affluence, that e<br>
        ascribed to many families having too much money and too <br>
        little wisdom in using it.<br>
        <br>
        (note in left-side margin)<br>
        and it may be that <br>
        many of the younger<br>
        generation are still<br>
        suffering from the <br>
        effects on them during<br>
        their infancy of the<br>
        war and its aftermath.<br>
        But it is difficult to<br>
        attribute the present<br>
        trend of juvenile<br>
        delinquency wholly<br>
        to things of that kind, <br>
        which one would<br>
        expect to be of<br>
        diminishing<br>
        importance as<br>
        time goes by.</p>
