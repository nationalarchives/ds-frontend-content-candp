<p class="s_titlesm">PUNISHMENT: The Big Question</p>
<p class="s_titlesm">Has the purpose of punishment changed over time?</p>
<p>You may want to print out these instructions so you can refer to them as you work.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#howtowork">How to work online</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this Strand you will find evidence of the changing story of punishment over 700 years. This story is split into four Galleries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Before 1450</li>
	<li>1450-1750</li>
	<li>1750-1900</li>
	<li>Since 1900</li>
</ul>

<p>In each Gallery there are several Case-Studies, with sources giving you real evidence of real punishments used in England in the past.</p>

<p>Your CHALLENGE is to decide whether, over the centuries, punishment has changed in what it is trying to achieve.</p>

<p>There are lots of documents in the four Galleries in this Punishment Strand so we have made a selection for you to choose from. Your task is to use them in a TV programme you are making to show all the possible reasons for punishing offenders which have been used over time. These are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Removing the offender from society (temporarily or permanently)</li>
	<li>Hurting the offender (physically or financially)</li>
	<li>Detering others</li>
	<li>Public shame</li>
	<li>Changing the offender so he/she avoids crime in the future</li>
</ol>

<p>For each of the five reasons, find ONE or TWO examples, from different periods, to show what it meant in practice.  Write the sound track for each example, of not more than two sentences, explaining what it shows and why you have chosen it.</p>

<!-- Big question help removed from here --
<p class="s_titlesm">How to work online</p>
<p>The Big Question page has a list of sources that can be found on the Crime and Punishment site. You choose which sources go with which reason in your TV programme, and then write a short sound track that says how your source explains the point you're making in the programme.</p>

<p>Follow the links to a source and decide which reason you want to use it with. Use your browser's "Back" button to return to the Big Question page and pick one reason number from the right-hand column. Then fill in the text box with a short sound track. Don't write more than four or five lines in each sound track box (there is a limit to how much text will be saved).</p>

<p>At any time you can save your work or see how your "storyboard" (programme plan) is looking by using the buttons at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p class="s_titlesm">Signing in</p>

<p>You can work online without signing in, but your work will not be saved when you leave the computer. Use the link at the top of the main page to sign in and permanently save your work. This will also retrieve any work you saved earlier.</p>

<p class="s_titlesm">Saving and printing</p>

<p>To save your work at any time click the "Save my work so far" button.</p>

<p>To produce your finished storyboard (or to see what a partially finished storyboard will look like) click the "Create my storyboard" button. Your storyboard will be displayed as a Web page which can be saved onto your own computer or printed out. On most computers you can choose "Save As..." or "Print..." from the "File" menu.</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> Your work may be cleared out if you do not use the Learning Curve for more than 20 minutes - this is done automatically by the computer. Remember to regularly use the save button, and to sign in if you want to come back to your work another day!</p>
