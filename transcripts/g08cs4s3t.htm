        <span class="s_default">Thus, the chief constable<br>
        of Chester states: -- &quot;We had five stout fellows came from Manchester,<br>
        notorious thieves ; there was no doubt that they came for the purpose 
        of plundering.<br>
        They were sent for seven days, and their hair was cropped-they were afterwards<br>
        apprehended ten or twelve miles distant, and it was known that they had 
        been in<br>
        our gaol. I recollect Booth the constable taking them ; they had been 
        in our<br>
        gaol one day, and he had got them taking to Knutsford the next.<br>
        &quot;What legal right have you to apprehend them and crop their hair?-The<br>
        Mayor, who is a man of few words, says he crops them for cleanliness.<br>
        &quot;Do you think that system is effectual with the vagrants you get 
        from the<br>
        various districts?-Yes.<br>
        &quot;Then the town itself is very little infested?-Very little indeed-we 
        do not<br>
        in fact allow them to beg-I do no mean to say we have no beggars.<br>
        &quot;Before the Police was established, this town was infested, both 
        with vagrants<br>
        and migratory depredators from other towns, was it not?-Yes it was, and 
        others<br>
        used to go to a distance, and commit robberies, and come here to spend 
        their<br>
        money and their time. At Chester Races we have had 800 known thieves.<br>
        &quot;How have you dealt with them?-They dare not come near us now-I adopted 
        the plan of apprehending them before the races, and keeping them in custody 
        till<br>
        the races were over.<br>
        &quot;What law had you for that?-I took that upon myself.<br>
