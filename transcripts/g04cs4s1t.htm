      <p class="s_default">I nath. Carrington, one of His Majesty's<br>
        messengers, being on Friday the 19th. of June<br>
        1730, about 10 of ye Clock at night, Dispatched<br>
        with Letters from both the Secretarys of State<br>
        and Mr. Reiche, at Windsor to London, was,<br>
        betwixt the Hours of 10 &amp;11 the said night,<br>
        attacked, in a place above a mile beyond - <br>
        Longford leading to Hounslow Heath, by a<br>
        little siz'd Man, who had on a light Drab <br>
        Coloured Horseman's Coat, the Cape Buttoned<br>
        about his face and his Hat Flapped before,<br>
        his Horse of a dark Bay Coulour, with a <br>
        Switch Tail, who immediately presented a <br>
        Pistol to my Breast, and bid me to Stand<br>
        and deliver my money. Whereupon I -<br>
        answered him, I was the King's Messenger<br>
        and had nothing but Letters of the King's,<br>
        and then shewed him my Escutcheon; to -<br>
        which he replyed, Damn the King's Letters<br>
        I dont' want them or your Escutcheon or<br>
        anything else that belongs to the King, <br>
        but only your Money, and immediately<br>
        put his hand into my Pocket (the Pistol<br>
        being still at my Breast) and took thereout<br>
        betwixt</p>
      <p class="s_default"> (new Page)</p>
      <p class="s_default">betwixt 13 &amp; 14 Shillings being all I had about<br>
        me, after which he said I must go along with <br>
        him, and then he took my Horse by the Head,<br>
        with his Pistol in his hand, and led him up<br>
        a Lane that was just by, and thereunder a<br>
        Hedge he dismounted his Horse and Searched<br>
        my Pockets, Boots etc.?a, and took out of my<br>
        pocket some Packets, which he swore had<br>
        money in them, but after having handled<br>
        them, and considered some time with himself, <br>
        and upon my assuring him they were Letters <br>
        belonging to the King, he returned me the<br>
        Packets unopened; and after having kept<br>
        me about 20 minutes, mounted his Horse, <br>
        asked me if I knew him (but commanded<br>
        me at the same time not to look in his Face)<br>
        and what was my name, and then rode off,<br>
        without taking either my Dispatches, Escutcheon<br>
        or anything else except my money. And I <br>
        was informed by the man at theTurnpike on<br>
        Hounslow Heath, that a Coach was just gone <br>
        by that was robbed at the same place I was, and<br>
        by the same man, according to their Description.<br>
        The Highway man at going off shook me<br>
        by the Hand, and said, that provided I would not<br>
        tell</p>
      <p class="s_default"> (New Page)</p>
      <p class="s_default">tell that I had been Stopp'd &amp; robbed, when-<br>
        -ever I came that way again, if I should meet<br>
        him, I need only tell him my name, and he<br>
        would not stop me any more.</p>
