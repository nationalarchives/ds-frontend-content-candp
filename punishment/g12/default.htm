      <p><span class="s_titlesm">What was the purpose of 20th century punishments?</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="s_defaultital">By 1900 the worries the Victorians had about 
        the uneducated masses in the cities and about crime had dwindled. There 
        was universal education, better housing, the police were an accepted part 
        of British life and the crime rate was lower. The big question in this 
        strand is about the purposes of punishments. British governments in the 
        first two thirds of the 20th century felt able to embark on new penal 
        policies which emphasised reform rather than punishment. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="s_default">Young offenders were removed entirely from the 
        adult justice system. Efforts were made to keep them out of custody, through 
        probation, begun in 1907. Borstal schools were started in1902, with the 
        aim of turning young offenders into better citizens. The same aims were 
        applied to adult prisons. Punitive rules were relaxed so that prisoners 
        could lead more normal lives. In an attempt to deal with unemployment 
        and family breakdown, which often led ex-prisoners back to crime, they 
        were given meaningful work, with pay, and family visits were made easier. 
        Even more controversially, capital punishment, the ultimate punishment 
        throughout all history, was abolished in 1965.<br>
        However, times changed in the last decades of the century. Crime was increasing 
        (see Gallery 10), young people were involved in violent crime, often associated 
        with football hooliganism. There was less sympathy with trying to reform 
        offenders, more sympatyhy for the victims of crime and more desire to 
        punish. Borstals were closed and Detention Centres, giving a &quot;short, 
        sharp shock&quot; were started. From 1972, offenders could be given Community 
        Service Orders. This meant doing many hours of socially worthwhile work 
        to show that the offender was repaying a debt to society. In the 1990s 
        tagging was introduced for offenders as a way of keeping them out of trouble. 
        In some areas offenders have been brought face-to-face with their victims 
        in an effort to help both get over the crime and move on.</span></p>

        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the sources 
        in each. There are HINTS in each to help you get the most out of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of the Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery 12 Worksheet.<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only really be able to answer 
        the Key Question when you have done all the Case-Studies. However, you 
        could divide the job between two halves of the class, sharing their results.</span><br>
