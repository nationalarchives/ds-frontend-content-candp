      <p>WHEN people speak of smuggling nowadays they think only of stray travellers 
        to and from the Continent who try to evade payment of duty on bottles 
        of perfume or small quantities of spirit. They regard the days of contraband 
        cargo running under cover of darkness as a thing of the very distant past, 
        and they talk as though the smuggling instinct had been lost by those 
        who live on our coasts. But we know better.</p>
      <p> (text omitted)</p>
      <p> Nightly we learn of strange boats putting at quiet places along the 
        coast,but by the time the spot is reached the craft have vanished, and 
        the ghostly</p>
      <p>figures who stole ashore from them have passed into the darkness out 
        of our ken, or the accomplices of the fishermen we find with their boats 
        have been equally quick in vanishing. There is no difficulty about obtaining 
        along the coast liberal quantities of spirits and wines that have not 
        paid duty, or that have never been in bond on this side. Those who know 
        their way about can always lay hands on supplies of undiluted spirits 
        and other articles.</p>
