      <p class="s_default">(The State of Prisons)</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        a)<br>
        My reader will judge of its malignity, when<br>
        I assure him, that my clothes were in my first journeys so<br>
        offensive, that in a post-chaise I could not bear the windows<br>
        drawn up; and was therefore obliged to travel commonly on<br>
        horseback. The leaves of my memorandum-book were often<br>
        so tainted, that I could not use it till after spreading it an hour<br>
        or two before the fire:</p>
      <p class="s_default">b)<br>
        Many who went on healthy, are in a few months changed to<br>
        emaciated dejected objects. Some are seen pining under<br>
        diseases, &quot;sick, and in prison&quot; ; expiring on the floors, in 
        loath-<br>
        some cells, of pestilential fevers, and the confluent smallpox;<br>
        victims, I must not say to the cruelty, but I will say to the<br>
        inattention, of sheriffs, and gentlemen in the commission of <br>
        the Peace.</p>
      <p class="s_default">c)<br>
        Many prisons have no water. This defect is frequent in bride-<br>
        wells, and town gaols. In the felons' courts of some county<br>
        gaols there is no water: in some places where there is water,<br>
        prisoners are always locked up within doors, and have no more<br>
        (next page)<br>
        than the keeper or his servants think fit to bring them: in one<br>
        place they were limited to three pints a day each: a scanty <br>
        provision for drink and cleanliness!</p>
      <p class="s_default">d)<br>
        I must here add, that in some few gaols are confined idiots<br>
        and lunatics. These serve for sport to idle visitants at assizes,<br>
        and other times of general resort.</p>
      <p class="s_default">e)<br>
        And petty offenders who are committed to<br>
        bridewell for a year or two, and spend that time, not in hard<br>
        labour, but in idleness and wicked company, or are sent for<br>
        that time to county gaols, generally grow desperate, and come<br>
        out fitted for the perpetration of any villainy. Half the robberies<br>
        committed in and about London, are planned in the prisons, by<br>
        that dreadful assemblage of criminals, and the number of idle<br>
        people who visit them. - How contrary this to the intention of<br>
        our laws with regard to petty offenders; which certainly is to<br>
        correct and reform them!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="s_default">f)<br>
        Men and women felons have their day-rooms apart, at the <br>
        upper end of the court. Women sleep in their day-room: but<br>
        the court being common, the men associate with them. Men<br>
        have for their night-rooms two vaulted cells. One of them, the<br>
        low dungeon, is ten steps underground, twenty-one feet by<br>
        nine, extremely close, dark, and unwholesome; very hot even <br>
        in winter. Their other cell, the high dungeon (twenty feet<br>
        two inches by eleven feet two), is close and offensive, though<br>
        not underground; and had an iron-latticed door.</p>
