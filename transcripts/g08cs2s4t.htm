      <p class="s_default"><br>
        Now, my fine fellows, as Secretary of S-te, I have in behalf of the Whigs, 
        Tories, Bishops, and Placemen,<br>
        Pensioners, Sabbath Protectors, Tax Eaters , Slave Owners, Land Owners, 
        Money Jobbers, and the<br>
        remainder of the honourable and united body of the Nonproductives and 
        Donothings, to return you<br>
        their sincere thanks for the vigilant, firm, orderly, forbearing, sensible, 
        discreet, and admirable manner<br>
        in which you discharge your duties, particularly in these important and 
        dangerous times, when the<br>
        spirit of that humbug Liberty is now spreading to an alarming degree, 
        and to the danger of all true<br>
        lovers of non-resistance, passive obedience, and kingly divinity. It is, 
        my friends, the first duties of a <br>
        good Monarchial Government, to act in direct opposition to the general 
        voice of the people: and as you<br>
        were enrolled and organized in opposition to the wishes of the public, 
        so must ye be perpetually<br>
        maintained by them, for it has always been the rule of this Government 
        to say &quot;no,&quot; when the people<br>
        say &quot;yes,&quot; and the reverse. Therefore, my lads, you are always 
        justified in breaking the heads of the<br>
        public when you consider it absolutely necessary for the maintenance of 
        the public peace, not even<br>
        excepting your own wives and families; for, according to the law, they 
        have no business in your way;<br>
        besides, my lads, you are aware that the oath of one of ye, however doubtful, 
        as good as the oaths of<br>
        twenty respectable housekeepers, however doubtless. Therefore, you are 
        always sure of protection<br>
        from these judicial old women, the Magistrates who receive their advices 
        from the Government as well<br>
        as their pay and pensions. Now, my lads, I have nothing further to say 
        to ye, in dismissing ye, excepting<br>
        that ye do for the future obtain as much as possible from supplying the 
        different parishes with<br>
        children, to the inconvenience to the servant maids, and at the expense 
        of the parishioners ; and also I <br>
        request that you will for the future bring with ye as small a quantity 
        of live stock about your persons as<br>
        you may find convenient, as well as for the dignity of so highly a respectable 
        body of spies and informers.</p>
