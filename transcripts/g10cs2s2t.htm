        Men fled, threw Drugs into dock</b></p>
      <p>THE midnight import of &quot;hashish&quot; - Indian hemp&quot; - from 
        a ship in Swansea Docks, by two Jamaicans who travelled by car from Liverpool 
        to collect it, was silently watched by police and Customs officers, Swansea 
        magistrates were told yesterday. Then, as the officers closed in, the 
        men threw the packets, containing 4 &frac12; lbs. of the drug, into King's 
        Dock, and ran in opposite directions.</p>
      <p>The Jamaicans, 30-year-old crane driver Roy Thompson, of old Normanby 
        street, and 38-year old motor mechanic Herman Sylvester McKay, of Jermyn 
        street, both of Liverpool, were sent to prison for six months on each 
        of three charges concerning the hemp, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>
