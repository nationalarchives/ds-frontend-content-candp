      <p>20. Unemployment among parents - However adequately<br>
        social legislation may provide for this eventuality, a long<br>
        period of unemployment must weaken the moral fibre of most<br>
        men and tend to make them less effective leaders in the home. </p>
      <p> (next page)</p>
      <p> Unemployment of the father has one other<br>
        effect ; when the father is out of work it not uncommonly<br>
        necessitates the mother becoming a wage-earner, with her<br>
        consequent absence from home when she is most needed there.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>(ii)</p>
      <p>22. The multiple store<br>
        The multiple store with its open display of goods, which<br>
        has now become a permanent feature of English town life, is<br>
        reputed to be a hunting ground of the juvenile delinquent.</p>
      <p> (iii)</p>
      <p> There are, for example, certain</p>
      <p> (next page)</p>
      <p>types of film, the influence of which has lately been accentu-<br>
        ated by the introduction of the spoken word and the song of <br>
        the sound film, which tend to promote unhealthy relations<br>
        between the sexes. They may possibly not be injurious to the<br>
        adult, but they are not to be regarded as harmless to young<br>
        people in later adolescence. There are no statistics to show<br>
        that they are a direct cause of delinquency, but there is no<br>
        doubt that they constitute an incitement to looseness of<br>
        conduct in juveniles which is subsequently reflected in a <br>
        lowering of the moral standard. It would be desirable for<br>
        the attention of the Entertainments Committee of the Council<br>
        to be drawn to these matters.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>(iv)</p>
      <p> There are, for example, some parents whose desire<br>
        seems to be to get children out of their sight while they seek<br>
        their own pleasures elsewhere, and others who with the<br>
        largely increased opportunities for adult relaxation, become<br>
        increasingly apathetic towards their children.</p>
      <p>(v)</p>
      <p>27. -Another serious factor making for laxity in modern <br>
        homes is a changed moral atmosphere, a legacy of war con-<br>
        ditions. A great many of the present generation of fathers<br>
        served during the war, when it became a widespread habit to<br>
        &quot;acquire&quot; by the simple process of &quot;winning&quot;. &quot;Winning&quot;<br>
        an article was not considered on the footing of stealing it, and<br>
        a new term and a new morality commended in the habit of<br>
        &quot;scrounging&quot; or &quot;scrumping.&quot; This practice outlived 
        the<br>
        war period ; it persists in all classes of people, and it persists <br>
        in the homes of some of the children and young persons now<br>
        being considered. Parents to whom &quot;stealing&quot; would be a <br>
        more serious matter dismiss the delinquent acts of their<br>
        children on the grounds that it was &quot;only scrounging</p>
