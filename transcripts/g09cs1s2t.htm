      <p class="s_default">(Parliamentary Papers 1847 vol.xiii 1-547</p>
      <p class="s_default">(a.)</p>
      <p class="s_default"> It will be perhaps useful, and give a clearer insight 
        to the subject, to describe<br>
        briefly the present extent of the convict establishment at Woolwich. It<br>
        comprises the &quot;Warrior&quot;, an old 74: the &quot;Justitia,&quot; 
        formerly used as a store-<br>
        ship, and built in India; the &quot;Unit&eacute;,&quot; an old French 
        frigate; and the &quot;Wye,&quot;<br>
        a ship sloop. </p>
      <p class="s_default"> (text omitted)</p>
      <p class="s_default"> The plan adopted for accommodating the convicts on 
        board the ships is con-<br>
        venient, and well adapted for the purposes of inspection. The decks are 
        divided longitudinally, leaving a passage in the centre for the guard 
        to patrol in during the<br>
        night. The space on each side is parted into small rooms, where the convicts, 
        in<br>
        classes of from 10 to 20 men in each, eat their meals and sleep. The central 
        cor-<br>
        ridor is formed by a barrier of open iron railings on each side. The men 
        sleep in<br>
        hammocks, and were the passage well lighted at night with gas, it would 
        be even<br>
        a more effective check against disorder than it is at present. The hospital-ship 
        is<br>
        not divided into classes, the decks being left flush, and the patients 
        sleeping on iron bedsteads.</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        (b.)</p>
      <p class="s_default"> It is fully established in evidence,<br>
        that at night the dying convict has been left without the attendance of 
        an officer,<br>
        and at the complete mercy of a watchman a prisoner selected from among 
        the<br>
        patients in hospital; that, unless he expresses a wish, no minister of 
        religion attends<br>
        his last moments; that the breath of life has scarcely escaped his lips, 
        when the bed<br>
        on which he has lain is ransacked by his fellow-prisoners, to find and 
        posses them-selves of any trifling articles he may have concealed ; that 
        the fact of his death is<br>
        only announced through a skylight to a guard upon deck, and no further 
        notice <br>
        taken of it until morning ; that the corpse is removed from the unscreened 
        bed, laid<br>
        upon the deck, and washed in the full sight of the patients : afterwards 
        placed<br>
        in a coffin, taken on shore to the Arsenal wharf in a boat, then placed 
        in a wheel-<br>
        barrow, and wheeled round to the dead-house, and there deposited until 
        taken away<br>
        under the provisions of the Anatomy Act or interred in the burial-place 
        in the<br>
        Marshes. In the latter case, the coffin, without pall or covering, is 
        carried out<br>
        early in the morning to the ground, and there left until the hour fixed 
        by the<br>
        chaplain for reading the burial service, when the steward of the ship, 
        with six<br>
        convicts, are present.</p>
