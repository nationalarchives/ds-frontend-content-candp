      <p class="s_default">1081. HENRY MASON, stealing 5lbs. of tea, value 5s. 
        ; the goods of<br>
        Frederick Besley and others, his masters ; and JOHN BASTISHALL feloni-<br>
        ously receiving the same.<br>
        MESSRS. CLARKSON and Cooper conduced the Prosecution.<br>
        THOMAS LLOYD. I am a constable. Mason was an overlooker in the tea<br>
        Department at Nicholson's wharf. On Saturday, 21st April, about two o'clock<br>
        I was on the wharf and saw Mason come out of the warehouse - I followed<br>
        him into the Queen's Head public-house, which adjoins the premises - I 
        went<br>
        in and saw him there, sitting on the settle, close to Batishall - I staid 
        there<br>
        about five minutes and then left - I saw Mason come out and go into the 
        <br>
        warehouse - he came out again, and I asked him who the man was that I 
        had<br>
        seen in the parlour at Howard's (the Queen's Head) with him -he said that 
        it<br>
        was only a man that his brother Jem knew - I asked if he had any tea about<br>
        him - he said, &quot;No&quot; -I felt in his apron and there found 3lbs. 
        of tea in<br>
        the pocket - I said he had better come and see Mr. Besley, one of the 
        part-<br>
        ners - he said that if I would let him go he would give me a sovereign 
        ; that<br>
        he had a wife who was nearly dead, and a large family ; that he would 
        give<br>
        me anything if I would let him go - I then sent for Mr. Besley and went 
        to<br>
        the Queen's Head and looked where the two prisoners had been sitting, 
        and<br>
        found a small quantity of tea on the settle, and a little on the ground 
        where<br>
        they had been sitting - I afterwards went after Batishall ; I found him 
        in<br>
        Botolph-lane, with a bundle in his hand - I asked if he had any tea about 
        <br>
        him - he said, &quot;No&quot; - I examined the bundle and found that it 
        contained<br>
        4 or 5lbs. of tea -&#133;</p>
