      <p>Imagine a time-helicopter is travelling over England in the 1240s. Two 
        historians are on board: Miss Laura Biding and Ms Vi O'Lent. The two historians 
        cannot agree on what medieval England was like. Miss Biding thinks they 
        did their best to live by the law and to make the legal system work; Ms. 
        O'Lent thinks people were uneducated and violent. Criminals got away with 
        murder (literally) as well as other crimes. The courts were feeble and 
        ineffective.</p>
      <p>There is one more seat in the helicopter: yours. Help the two researchers 
        by supplying them with statements which support one or both of them in 
        their point of view. Use what you have learnt from the Case-Studies and 
        anything else you have found out from this section of the Gallery. Add 
        the relevant information to the table below.</p>
      <p> (Some key-words for adding to one side or other: <br>
        O'Lent: murder, domestic violence, rape, arson, outlaws.<br>
        Biding: jury, Eyre court, statistics, judge, outlaw)</p>
