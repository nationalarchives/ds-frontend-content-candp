      <p class="s_default">Alan the cook killed Ellis, Maud de Gurnay's doorkeeper, 
        and<br>
        fled, so he was exacted and outlawed. Richard Mansel, charged with the<br>
        death, fled and is suspected, so he is exacted and outlawed. Brian, <br>
        Maud's functionary, Emma her laundress, and Richard her hayward<br>
        were guilty of that death and fled, so exacted and outlawed. Alan was<br>
        not in tithing but in Maud's household, as were all the others except<br>
        Richard the hayward, so she is in mercy. None of them had chattels. The<br>
        vill of Mapledurham Gurnay did not present the plea at the county court, 
        <br>
        so in mercy. The coroners witness that Jordan de Bideford pledged to<br>
        have Richard Mansel before the justices, so in mercy.<br>
        Afterwards Richard comes, and he is a clerk and is delivered to [Robert<br>
        Grosseteste] bishop of Lincoln. Error.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> (next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default">Afterwards Ellis came and appeared before the justices, 
        and since the<br>
        court established that he is the same man who was presented as killed,<br>
        nothing of the whole plea, and all those accused of the death may come<br>
        back. The 12 jurors of the vill of Mapledurham Chazey and <br>
        Mapledurham Gurnay in mercy for a false presentment<br>
