      <p class="s_titlesm">What was the most important factor affecting crime 
        in the 20th Century?</p>
      <p class="s_default"><i>The BIG QUESTION in this Strand is about how much 
        crime has changed over the centuries. There are several factors which 
        affect crime in any period. The 20th century saw big changes in almost 
        every one of them:</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="s_default"> The economy. By the early 20th century many of 
          the old industries on which Britain's industrial supremacy had been 
          based were in decline. In the 1930s depression they were hit hard: national 
          unemployment in 1933 was 22%, but in parts of northern England, Scotland 
          and Wales it was much higher. Some people did not have a job for twenty 
          years. At the same time, new industries: electricity, radio, cars, household 
          goods sprung up in new areas. There were thus huge contrasts of wealth 
          and poverty between areas and between classes for much of the century. 
          In the search for work, people increasingly moved around the country, 
          making communities less stable and people more unknown to each other.</li>
        <li><span class="s_default">Technology. Several new inventions had effects 
          on crime, but the greatest of these by far was the motorcar (see</span> 
          <a href="g10cs1.htm" class="cplink">Case Study 1</a><span class="s_default">). 
          Aeroplanes made international transport and smuggling easier. The impact 
          of new forms of entertainment, particularly the cinema and TV, worried 
          many people. By the end of the century, the widespread use of computers 
          created new kinds of crime. </span></li>
        <li class="s_default">Government. In the twentieth century governments 
          took on new roles: the &quot;Welfare State&quot;, begun by the Liberals, 
          1906-14, and continued by the Labour governments of 1945-51, gave greater 
          security to all citizens. For the first time in History, there was no 
          danger of starving to death, or dying in total poverty. There was free 
          medical care on the National Health Service and universal, free education 
          to 16. The government also created laws intended to change attitudes, 
          such as outlawing sex and race discrimination. </li>
        <li class="s_default">War. The two World Wars,1914-18 and 1939-45, brought 
          all kinds of changes. Apart from the destruction of homes and towns, 
          family life was disrupted by conscription and evacuation. The government 
          acquired all kinds of new powers to intervene in people's lives.</li>
        <li class="s_default">Beliefs. At the same time, religious belief declined. 
          Attitudes were shaped more by TV and newspapers than by the churches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="s_default"> Did all these factors affect crime equally? Which 
        was the most important?<br>
        In the Case-Studies of this Gallery of the Crime Strand you will find 
        examples of all these factors affecting crime. It is your task to analyse 
        which is the most important.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><span class="s_default">Four Case-Studies:<br>
        </span><a href="g10cs1.htm"><span class="cplink">1. Car Crime<br>
         </span></a> <a href="g10cs2.htm"><span class="cplink">2. Smuggling 
        <br>
        </span></a> <a href="g10cs3.htm"><span class="cplink">3. Young People 
        <br>
        </span></a> <a href="g10cs4.htm" class="cplink">4. Crime Figures</a></p>
      <p><span class="s_default">How to Work<br>
        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the Sources 
        in each. There are HINTS in each Case-Study to help you get the most out 
        of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of your Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery Worksheet.<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only be able to answer the 
        Key Question when you have done most or all of the Case-Studies. However, 
        you could divide the job around the class, sharing your results from different 
        versions of the Gallery Worksheet.</span></p>
