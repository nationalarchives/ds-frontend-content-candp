      <p>Half British 'crime'<br>
        is by motorists<br>
        TEDDY BOYS ARE BETTER<br>
        By a Daily Mail Reporter<br>
        A HOME OFFICE report on law-breaking in Britain<br>
        yesterday showed that the class responsible for<br>
        more offences against the law in 1953 then any other<br>
        was - the motoring class.<br>
        This &quot;criminal&quot; class, in-<br>
        cluding motor-cyclists, cyclists,<br>
        drivers of cars, lorries, and <br>
        other &quot;mechanically-propelled<br>
        vehicles,&quot; was responsible for<br>
        more than half of all offences<br>
        committed throughout Eng-<br>
        land and Wales.<br>
        (text omitted)</p>
      <p> The &quot;Teddy boy&quot; according to <br>
        the Home Office figures, appar-<br>
        ently is not quite the menace to <br>
        safety and public peace that his<br>
        occasionally noisy behaviour<br>
        might suggest. Certainly he be-<br>
        haved himself better than in the <br>
        previous year.</p>
      (ii) Daily Mirror 27.8.54 
      <p> Daily Mirror<br>
        KEEP IT UP,<br>
        KIDS!<br>
        HURRAH for statistics! At last they<br>
        prove something we want to hear<br>
        about.<br>
        The crime figures are falling.<br>
        They're falling generally. But most<br>
        important, the number of serious crimes<br>
        committed by CHILDREN is lower than<br>
        at any time since 1947.<br>
        That's one in the eye for the Blimps<br>
        and Dammits who rumble about modern<br>
        youth going to the dogs.<br>
        Let's roll the figures round our tongues<br>
        for a minute. In 1951, 28,000 children<br>
        between eight and fourteen were found<br>
        guilty of indictable offences - larceny,<br>
        breaking and entering, that sort of thing.<br>
        In 1952 there were 26,000. Last year the<br>
        figure was down to 22,000.<br>
        This Happy Breed<br>
        See how they drop! Now we can start<br>
        waving good-bye to the &quot;crime wave.&quot;<br>
