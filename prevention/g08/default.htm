      <p><span class="s_defaultital">The BIG QUESTION in this Strand is about 
        turning-points in crime prevention. In this Gallery, crime prevention 
        methods take a great leap towards our present system, with the first police 
        forces. But why did this happen at this time?</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="s_default">During the period covered by this gallery, Britain 
        went through some extraordinary changes. The population rose from 10 million 
        in 1750 to 42 million in 1900. In 1750 most of these people lived in villages 
        in the countryside; by 1900 most of the British people lived in towns 
        and cities. London was the only great city in Britain in 1750, with a 
        population of 675,000 people; this rose to over 3 million. But other places, 
        small rural towns or even villages in 1750, had become cities by 1900. 
        For example, Liverpool's population rose from 22,000 to 450,000; Manchester's 
        from 18,000 to 376,000; Preston's from 5,000 to 92,000, and so on. There 
        were new industries, new forms of transport; some people became newly 
        rich and many lived on the edge of poverty. All these factors brought 
        about massive changes in crime, which you can find out about in Gallery 
        7. <br>
        Crime prevention in Britain up to this period had relied on community 
        action (see Galleries </span><a href="../g02/default.htm" class="cplink">Crime 
        Prevention before 1450 </a><span class="cs_default">&amp;</span> <a href="../g05/default.htm" class="cplink">Crime 
        Prevention 1450-1750</a>. <span class="s_default">But communities had 
        now utterly changed. How could a crime prevention system designed for 
        villages of a few hundred people, most of whom knew each other, cope with 
        crime in a city of a million people, most of whom had arrived there only 
        recently from all over the country and abroad? What was to be done? Did 
        people agree over what was to be done? And how different were their solutions 
        to the crime problems of their era from policing in our own day?<br>
        In the Case-Studies in this Gallery of the Crime Prevention Strand you 
        can find out what the responses were, and how people reacted to them.</span></p>
      <p><span class="s_default">Five Case-studies:</span><br>
        1. <span><a href="g08cs1.htm" class="cplink">Sir John Fielding</a></span><br>
        2.<a href="g08cs2.htm" class="cplink"> Sir Robert Peel and the new Metropolitan 
        Police</a><br>
        3.<a href="g08cs3.htm" class="cplink"> Provincial police forces</a><br>
        4.<a href="g08cs4.htm" class="cplink"> The Growth of the police</a><br>
        5.<a href="g08cs5.htm" class="cplink"> Complaints and Criticisms</a></p>
      <p><span class="s_default">How To Work<br>
        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the Sources 
        in each. There are HINTS in each Case-Study to help you get the most out 
        of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of your Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery  Worksheet.<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only be able to answer the 
        Key Question when you have done most or all of the Case-Studies. </span></p>
