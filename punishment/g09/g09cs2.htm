                    (see Gallery </span><a href="../g06/default.htm" class="cplink">Punishment 
                    1450-1750</a><span class="cs_default">), had survived 
                    from earlier centuries almost unchanged. They began to be 
                    criticised in the late 18th century on a number of counts. 
                    All kinds of people were dumped in them together: men, women, 
                    children, lunatics, debtors and those simply awaiting trial. 
                    They were often ancient and unhealthy places, with no fresh 
                    water, or sewage disposal. What they called &quot;gaol fever&quot;, 
                    probably typhus, killed many inmates. Prisoners had to pay 
                    fees to their gaolers, so better off prisoners could survive 
                    quite well, while poor prisoners lived in squalor and rags. 
                    Local control and local rules meant that there was no common 
                    treatment policy across the country.</span></p>
                  <p class="cs_default">Several reformers, notably John Howard, 
                    described all these abuses, pointing out that prison was meant 
                    to be the punishment itself, not the sickness or death which 
                    could result. However, change came only gradually. In 1815 
                    gaolers began to be paid, instead of charging fees. Some new 
                    prisons were built to new designs, so that prisoners could 
                    be easily guarded, but lived in healthier conditions. </p>
                  <p><span class="cs_default">Not until the 1830s, with crime 
                    on the increase, did the great debate begin on prisons and 
                    how they should be run. As other punishments faded out of 
                    use and transportation ended, (See </span><a href="g09cs1.htm" class="cplink">Case 
                    Study 1</a><span class="cs_default">), prison became the normal 
                    punishment for most serious offenders. But how should they 
                    be run?</span></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="cs_default"> The Separate system. Under this system, 
                      based on Cherry Hill Prison in Pennsylvania, USA, prisoners 
                      were kept in solitary confinement, in order to think about 
                      their life and crimes. It was believed that they would then 
                      come face to face with the error of their ways. Living conditions 
                      were good, but convicts had nothing to do. Christian ideas 
                      of repentance and judgement were emphasised. The Chaplain 
                      played an important part in this. At Pentonville, a new 
                      prison opened in 1842 under the separate system, several 
                      prisoners went mad and three committed suicide.</li>
                    <li class="cs_default">The Silent system. Under this system, 
                      based on Auburn Prison, New York, USA, prisoners had to 
                      work, but in total silence. </li>
                    <li class="cs_default">Hard bed, hard board, hard labour. 
                      In the last part of the 19th century prisons were made even 
                      tougher, under a regime called &quot;hard bed, hard board, 
                      hard labour&quot;. Hard plank beds replaced hammocks, food 
                      was deliberately boring and inmates had to work hard on 
                      monotonous, even pointless tasks.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="cs_default">To further bring prisons into line, they 
                    were all taken out of local control and put under the government, 
                    through the Home Office, in 1877. By this time the usual sentence 
                    was one year in solitary confinement, followed by three years 
                    hard labour. Even time off for good behaviour was stopped.</p>
