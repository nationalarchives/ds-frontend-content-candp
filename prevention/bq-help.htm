<p class="s_titlesm">CRIME PREVENTION: The Big Question</p>
<p class="s_titlesm">What were the key turning-points in the history of crime prevention in Britain?</p>
<p>You may want to print out these instructions so you can refer to them as you work.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#howtowork">How to work online</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this Strand you will find evidence of the changing story of crime prevention in England over 1000 years. This story is split into four Galleries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before 1450</li>
<li>1450-1750</li>
<li>1750-1900</li>
<li>Since 1900</li>
</ul>
<p>In each Gallery you will find several Case-Studies, with sources giving you real evidence of crime prevention systems in different periods.</p>
<p>You will be looking at a millennium of change and continuity: sometimes crime prevention methods changed a great deal, rapidly, sometimes they hardly changed at all for centuries, or only very slowly. Your CHALLENGE is to identify documents which illustrate the key turning-points in this story.</p>

<p>To save you going through all the documents in the strand we have chosen a small collection for you to work with. Your task is to select sources which will illustrate these turning-points to someone who only has fifteen minutes to spare to understand the story.</p>
<p>The turning-points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The setting up of JPs in the Middle Ages</li>
<li>The setting up of police forces in the mid-19th century</li>
<li>The modernisation of the police in the 20th century</li>
<li>Evidence of continuity over a long period</li>
</ol>
<p>For each turning-point, choose no more than 4 documents which illustrate the point you are trying to make. Add a short caption to each document.</p>

<!-- Big question help removed from here --
<p class="s_titlesm">How to work online</p>
<p>The Big Question page has a list of sources that can be found on the Crime and Punishment site. You choose which sources go with which turning-point, and then write a short caption that says how your source explains the point you're making.</p>

<p>Follow the links to a source and decide which turning-point you want to use it in. Use your browser's "Back" button to return to the Big Question page and pick one turning-point number from the right-hand column. Then fill in the text box with a short caption. Don't write more than four or five lines in each caption box (there is a limit to how much text will be saved).</p>

<p>At any time you can save your work or see how your work is looking by using the buttons at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p class="s_titlesm">Signing in</p>

<p>You can work online without signing in, but your work will not be saved when you leave the computer. Use the link at the top of the main page to sign in and permanently save your work. This will also retrieve any work you saved earlier.</p>

<p class="s_titlesm">Saving and printing</p>

<p>To save your work at any time click the "Save my work so far" button.</p>

<p>To produce your finished work (or to see what your partially finished work will look like) click the "Create my final work" button. Your work will be displayed as a Web page which can be saved onto your own computer or printed out. On most computers you can choose "Save As..." or "Print..." from the "File" menu.</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> Your work may be cleared out if you do not use the Learning Curve for more than 20 minutes - this is done automatically by the computer. Remember to regularly use the save button, and to sign in if you want to come back to your work another day!</p>
