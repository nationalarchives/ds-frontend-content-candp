      <p class="s_titlesm">What was the purpose of the punishments used in the 
        period 1750-1900?</p>
      <p class="s_defaultital">During the period covered by this Gallery there 
        were serious debates about the purposes of punishment. Many new ideas 
        were tried in answer to the old problem of what to do with those who break 
        the law.<br>
        <br>
      <p class="s_default">Gradually, through this period, the older &quot;shaming&quot; 
        punishments like the stocks and the pillory fell out of use. So did whipping. 
        Fewer and fewer people were hanged. Public executions became rowdy, lawless 
        occasions, and many people thought they were barbaric. They were stopped 
        in 1868 and from then onwards, hangings were carried out in private, in 
        prison.<br>
        For much of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century transportation 
        was a common punishment. At first convicts were sent to America, then, 
        after US independence in 1776, to Australia. Transportation seemed to 
        have many advantages: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="s_default">It was believed that crimes were committed 
          by a &quot;criminal class&quot;, so removing the offenders from the 
          country should cause crime to decline; </span><br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="s_default">Little was known about Australia, so fear 
          of the unknown might deter people from committing crimes; </span><br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="s_default">The convict had the chance to think about 
          changing his or her ways. </span><br>
        </li>
        <li class="s_default">The convicts also provided labour to build up British 
          colonies overseas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="s_default">19th century governments were prepared to get 
        involved in many aspects of society which governments had not ventured 
        into before. They intervened in factories, mines and public health, set 
        up schools and police (See Gallery </span><a href="../../prevention/g08/default.htm" class="cplink">Crime 
        Prevention 1750-1900</a><span class="s_default">). They also decided 
        to try to solve the growing crime problem.<br>
        Crime was still increasing, so transportation was obviously not working. 
        It also seemed unreasonable to give criminals free passage to Australia 
        when others were paying to go there. Anyway, Australians were agitating 
        to put an end to using their new country as a criminal dump. The answer 
        was prison. <br>
        Prisons had changed little since medieval times. John Howard pointed out 
        how awful they were in 1777 and other reformers had worked to improve 
        them. But it was not until the 1830s that a major effort was made to make 
        prison the core of Britain's punishment system, which it still is. There 
        was a crisis as transportation ended and there were not enough prisons. 
        For a while 70% of prisoners were kept in the &quot;hulks&quot; -disused 
        warships. Then a massive prison-building programme began: 90 prisons were 
        built between 1840 and 1877, at enormous public expense.<br>
        There was considerable debate over what prisons were for, and this affected 
        how they were run: the &quot;r&eacute;gime&quot; as it was called. Two 
        big ideas were borrowed from the United States: the &quot;Separate System&quot; 
        was designed by deeply religious people to reform criminals through continuous 
        solitary confinement. On their own, it was believed, criminals would be 
        forced to think about repentance. The &quot;Silent System&quot; was just 
        as tough in its way, with convicts made to do hard, boring work in total 
        silence. <br>
        Ideas of punishment and deterrence dominated government attitudes to prison 
        for the rest of this period. &quot;Hard bed, hard board, hard labour&quot; 
        summed it up. At the same time there was a gradual move towards separate, 
        although still very tough, treatment for young offenders.<br>
        The BIG QUESTION in this Strand is about what punishments were supposed 
        to achieve. This Gallery has interesting examples of punishments of different 
        kinds, with different aims. What do you think was the point of each? Use 
        the Case-Studies and the Gallery Worksheet to analyse the purpose of each.</span></p>
      <p class="s_default">Case-Studies:<br>
      <p><a href="g09cs1.htm"  class="cplink">1. Transportation</a><br>
        <a href="g09cs2.htm" class="cplink">2. Prison reform</a><br>
        <a href="g09cs3.htm" class="cplink">3. Victorian prisons</a><br>
        <a href="g09cs4.htm" class="cplink">4. Treatment of young people</a></p>
      <p><span class="s_default">How To Work<br>
        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the sources 
        in each. There are HINTS in each to help you get the most out of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of the Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery Worksheet<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only really be able to answer 
        the Key Question when you have done both the Case-Studies. However, you 
        could divide the job between two halves of the class, sharing their results.</span><br>
