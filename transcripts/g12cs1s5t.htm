        a<br>
        Prisoner discharged from Borstal Prison.</span></p>
      <p class="s_default">&quot;Sir, I have been reading the London papers every 
        week<br>
        and have seen in them that they call Borstal a <br>
        Palace of Indolence and that they give you a spring<br>
        bed and carpets and looking glasses but they don't<br>
        say that you have to do six months good conduct<br>
        first and they also said that when a boy misbehaves<br>
        himself the Governor just sends him to his room<br>
        for two or three days but they forget that it is a <br>
        empty cell half lighted and that you are deprived<br>
        of your food the time you are there and if you <br>
        happen to have the spring bed you lose that also for<br>
        six months and Sir I can truly say that it is<br>
        you that has saved me from a life of crime because<br>
        if I had of stopped at any other prison for my<br>
        sentence I would never have been free now whereas<br>
        since I left London I have always been in the best<br>
        of company and with people who prison is<br>
        unknown to and I have always got to be <br>
        thankful to you Sir. Now Sir I dont <br>
        think I have any more to say at present so<br>
        conclude.&quot;</p>
