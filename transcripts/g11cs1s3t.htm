      <p>In London yesterday a P.-c. gets out his tiny<br>
        two-way radio to call for reinforcements.</p>
      <p>(article)</p>
      <p><br>
        DOWN NOW TO 7 &frac12; oz</p>
      <p>THE HIDDEN<br>
        VOICE -<br>
        in yesterday's<br>
        crowds<br>
      </p>
      <p> <br>
        Towering head<br>
        and shoulders<br>
        above the crowd<br>
        outside St. Paul's<br>
        yesterday, a stern-<br>
        faced police con-<br>
        stable appeared to<br>
        be talking into his <br>
        hand.</p>
      <p> Crowds, who pressed <br>
        forward to catch a <br>
        glimpse of the VIPs<br>
        arriving for the memo-<br>
        rial service to President<br>
        Kennedy, wondered if<br>
        the P.-c. was holding a <br>
        conversation with his<br>
        four fingers and thumb.<br>
        Only the closest spotted<br>
        the tiny, two-way radio<br>
        held in his palm. It linked</p>
      <p>(next column)</p>
      <p><br>
        him with a traffic and<br>
        crowd operations room in<br>
        the City of London's police<br>
        headquarters, in nearby<br>
        Old Jewry.<br>
        From his spot in the <br>
        midst of the heaving<br>
        crowd, the policeman was summoning reinforcements<br>
        to control the swaying<br>
        spectators, who looked<br>
        like getting out of hand.<br>
        In the ops. Room, mes-<br>
        sages went out to a dozen<br>
        other P.-c.s to battle their<br>
        way into the area and the <br>
        messages, which crackled <br>
        out of the top pockets of <br>
        the constables through the<br>
        tiny radios, were individu-<br>
        ally acknowledged and the<br>
        reinforcements moved in.<br>
        The miniature two-way<br>
        radio was having its first<br>
        real work-out in crowd<br>
        and traffic control in the <br>
        City of London, famed for <br>
        its pageantry and State<br>
        occasions.</p>
      <p> <br>
        Fighting<br>
        Tomorrow, the two-way<br>
        radio will be fighting<br>
        crime as it links policemen<br>
        on the beat with their<br>
        operational headquarters.</p>
