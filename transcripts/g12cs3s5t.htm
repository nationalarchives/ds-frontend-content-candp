      Because it is not necessary as a deterrent. If it were, murder would have 
      increased where the death penalty has already been abolished. This has not 
      happened. Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden and many other countries 
      have found by long experience that other penalties, not open to such grave 
      objections, are equally effective. 
      <p>Because the sight of a person
        fighting for his life enlists sympathy
        for the murderer rather than for his
        victim, and creates a morbid
        interest which encourages news-
        papers to give widespread publicity
        to the sordid details of both crime
        and trial with demoralizing effects
        upon many who read them.</p>
      <p>Because this advertisement of
        murder sometimes leads abnormal
        or insane people to commit
        imitative crimes.</p>
      <p>Because we have no right to
        require public servants to perform
        so terrible a task as taking in cold
        blood the life of a fellow human
        being. A public hangman in Great 
        Britain, who had executed over two
        hundred people, committed suicide
        in 1932 after previously trying to
        murder his wife and daughter. His
        life was degraded in the public
        service.</p>
      <p>Because it is irrevocable. In
        spite of all our safeguards the
        execution of an innocent person is
        not impossible.</p>
    </td>
    <td class="s_default" width="50%"> <br>
      Because large numbers of people believe capital punishment to be barbarous 
      and immoral. A penalty which lacks the support of the public as a whole 
      is greatly weaken- ed in its effectiveness. There are recent cases in which 
      juries because of their horror of the death penalty have brought in verdicts 
      contrary to the evidence, and thus persons possibly guilty have been allowed 
      to go free. Certainty of conviction is an essential factor in the preven- 
      tion of crime. 
      <p>Because the reliance placed 
        upon the deterrent effect of the 
        death penalty tends to deaden the
        public mind to the need for remov-
        ing the bad social conditions and other 
        evils of which murder is often the final 
        product.</p>
      <p>Because the State, by refusing
        to take human life, will strengthen
        the sense of the sanctity of life
        among its citizens and thereby tend
        to reduce murder and other forms
        of violent crime.</p>
      <p>Because &quot;the business of a 
        Christian community is to redeem
        the offender&quot; (C.O.P.E.C&gt; Confer-
        ence resolution, 1924).</p>
      <p>Because after exhaustive en- quiry and investigation a Select Committee 
        of the House of Com- mons in 1930 endorsed these arguments and recommended 
        the abolition of the death penalty for an experimental period of five 
        years.</p>
