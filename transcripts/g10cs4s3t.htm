      <p>CRIMINAL STATISTICS, 1957.<br>
        (Cmnd. 529. price 8 shillings net)</p>
      <p> The rising trend in the total number of indictable offences known to 
        the<br>
        police that began in 1955 and continued during 1956 continued steeply<br>
        throughout 1957. The total for 1957 was 4% higher than at the previous 
        peak<br>
        in 1951 and 14% higher than in 1945. Judging by the statistics of convictions,<br>
        the increase in crime was much more rapid among juveniles over 14 and 
        young <br>
        men and women than among younger children or older men and women. The 
        most<br>
        serious proportionate increases were in robbery and in breaking and entering<br>
        offences, and the increase in offences of violence against the person 
        was<br>
        also large.</p>
