                  <p><span class="cs_default">Transportation had been used as 
                    a form of punishment since 1717. Under the &quot;Bloody Code&quot; 
                    (See Gallery </span><span class="cplink">Crime 1750-1900</span><span class="cs_default">), 
                    courts were looking for a punishment which was not as extreme 
                    as hanging, but tougher than a fine. In the absence of proper 
                    prisons, transportation seemed the answer and was used for 
                    over a hundred years. In the 18th century convicts were transported 
                    to America. After US independence in 1776, however, this option 
                    was closed and the British government looked for another destination. 
                    Australia had been mapped and claimed as British territory 
                    in 1770, so convicts began to be sent there. From 1787 to 
                    1857, 162,000 British convicts were transported to Australia. 
                    Seven out of eight of these were males; some were as young 
                    as nine or ten; some were over eighty. Many political prisoners 
                    were transported, including Luddites, Chartists, the Tolpuddle 
                    Martyrs and Irish Nationalists.</span></p>
                  <p class="cs_default">They were sent first to the &quot;hulks&quot; 
                    -disused warships. Conditions on these rotting vessels were 
                    often terrible, with death rates of one in three. The long 
                    voyage to Australia could take six months. Many lives were 
                    lost among the convicts, locked in iron cages below decks 
                    in insanitary conditions, although by the end of the transportation 
                    era more care was taken and loss of life on the voyage was 
                    minimised.</p>
                  <p class="cs_default">Once in Australia, convicts lived in barracks 
                    and worked in gangs, building roads and bridges or working 
                    on farms or quarries. Some were sent out to work for farmers. 
                    If they behaved themselves, their sentence could be reduced 
                    by a &quot;ticket of leave.&quot; The majority of convicts 
                    decided to stay in Australia at the end of their sentences, 
                    recognising that they could make a better life there than 
                    returning to Britain and, probably, poverty and crime.</p>
                  <p><span class="cs_default"> By the mid-19th century, however, 
                    opinion was turning against transportation. The &quot;Bloody 
                    Code&quot; had ended. It seemed wrong to offer convicts a 
                    free passage to build a new life in Australia when some people 
                    were paying to go. Removing criminals to another land did 
                    not seem to have had any effect on the crime-rate. Prisons 
                    were now considered a better method of punishing and/or reforming 
                    criminals (see </span><a href="g09cs2.htm"><span class="cplink">Case 
                    Study 2</span></a><span class="cs_default"> and </span><a href="g09cs3.htm" class="cplink">Case 
                    Study 3</a><span class="cs_default">) and many new ones were 
                    being built. Most of all, Australians began to object strongly 
                    to their country being used as a dumping-ground for Britain's 
                    criminals. </span></p>
