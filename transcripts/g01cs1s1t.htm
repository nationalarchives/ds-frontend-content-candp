      <p> <span class="s_default">Emma wife of Walter of Elsfield appeals Roger 
        Mock that on the Thursday after Epiphany [8 January] 1238 he came to her 
        in her house and hit her with a pair of tongs in the eye so that she lost 
        her right eye. And that he did this wickedly and feloniously against the 
        king's peace she offer to prove. Roger comes and denies everything, and 
        since it is demonstrated that she made no appeal against him until now 
        and this happened 3 years ago, it is adjudged that the appeal is null, 
        and let an enquiry be made by jury. The jurors say that Roger is not guilty, 
        so he is acquitted, and likewise John Mock who was appealed of force, 
        but they say that Walter of Elsfield, Emma's husband, hit her so that 
        she lost her eye, so he is committed to gaol.</span></p>
