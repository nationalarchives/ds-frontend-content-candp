      <ul>
        <li> There are 3 Strands in this Exhibition, each covering the themes 
          of 'Crime', 'Prevention' and 'Punishment'. Each Strand contains 4 Galleries 
          covering the designated theme through different time periods. This enables 
          students and teachers to use the Exhibition in different ways. For example, 
          students can examine Crime from before 1450 through to the 20th century 
          or they can look at 'Crime', 'Prevention' and 'Punishment' within a 
          specific time period (eg.before 1450).<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> There are 12 Galleries altogether in this Exhibition. Each Gallery 
          covers one of the themes within a specific time period eg. 'Punishment 
          1450-1750'. There is a Key Question for each Gallery. Students should 
          work through all of the Case-Studies in the Gallery and fill in the 
          Worksheet, which can be saved or printed by the student, in order to 
          answer the Key Question. There are guidance notes to assist with this 
          task.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Each Gallery contains a number of Case Studies. Each Case Study is 
          designed so that it can be used as a 'stand alone' item in one or two 
          classroom sessions. However, each Case Study in a Gallery is linked 
          to form a more coherent area of research. This has been done to give 
          students and teachers the maximum amount of flexibility.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
	        <li> Each source is accompanied, where appropriate, by hints and a transcript. 
          The latter is intended to cover the sections of the source needed to 
          answer the question and may, therefore, be shorter than the source itself.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>The Exhibition is accompanied by a glossary to assist students and 
          teachers with definitions of unfamiliar terms.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>At various points throughout the Exhibition, there are links to other 
          websites where extra information or other resources can be found. Please 
          note that the PRO is not responsible for the content of any external 
          website</li>
