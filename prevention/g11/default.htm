      <p class="s_titlesm">Did police work change dramatically in the 20th century?</p>
      <p><span class="s_default"><i>The BIG QUESTION in this strand asks about 
        key turning-points in crime prevention in Britain. The 20th century brought 
        enormous changes to nearly every aspect of life, so police work was bound 
        to be affected.<br>
        </i> <br>
        At the beginning of the 20th century there were still 181 police forces 
        in Britain. Many were very small: 41 of them had less than 50 policemen. 
        Different forces worked in different ways and there was little contact 
        or co-operation between them. There was no central criminal record-keeping. 
        Greater mobility of criminals and the need to make use of new technology 
        led to amalgamations of police forces: by 1946 there were 120 forces and 
        by 2000 there were only 41. <br>
        In 1900 there were 60,000 police; by 2000 there were over 125,000. Over 
        the century they became a much better-trained force. In 1900 new recruits 
        learnt the job by doing it; now each has 14 weeks training. A National 
        Police College was set up in 1947 to provide further training. Pay and 
        conditions, with grievances dating back to Victorian times, led to police 
        strikes in 1918 and 1919. Police are now banned from striking, but pay 
        and conditions are good. The first women joined the police in 1920. The 
        first women Chief Constable was appointed in 1996.<br>
        Some aspects of police work have changed much less. British police are 
        still normally unarmed, and their uniform, though altered regularly, still 
        looks much the same as it did in 1900, especially the helmet. One of the 
        biggest changes of the later 20th century, taking police off the beat 
        and putting them in cars, has not been popular and in many places the 
        walking beat has been restored.<br>
        20th century technology was adopted in order to meet new needs and to 
        improve police work. There are now many different specialist units, from 
        dog handlers to police laboratory staff. But has it led to a better police 
        force? Judge for yourself after looking at Case-Study 1.<br>
        However, all this must be set in the context of the post-1960 massive 
        increase in crime -see Gallery </span><a href="../../crime/g10/default.htm"><span class="cplink">Crime 
        in the 20th Century</span></a><span class="s_default">. This has been 
        accompanied by a much more critical attitude towards the police on the 
        part of the public. These changes, and police responses to them, are explored 
        in Case-Study 2. </span></p>
      <p><span class="s_default"> Two Case-Studies:<br>
        </span><a href="g11cs1.htm" class="cplink">1. Police work and New Technology</a><span class="s_default"> 
        <span class="cplink"><br>
        </span></span><a href="g11cs2.htm" class="cplink">2. Public attitudes 
        to the police.</a></p>
      <p class="s_default">How To Work<br>
        1. Work through each of these Case-Studies. Read and analyse the Sources 
        in each. There are HINTS in each Case-Study to help you get the most out 
        of the Sources.<br>
        2. At the end of your Case-Study, fill in some of the Gallery  Worksheet.<br>
        3. Move on to the next Case-Study. You will only be able to answer the 
        Key Question when you have done most or all of the Case-Studies.</p>
