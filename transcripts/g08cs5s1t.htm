        interested in the good manage-<br>
        ment and efficiency of the<br>
        New Police, that I feel myself<br>
        reluctantly bound to inform<br>
        you of the misconduct of<br>
        the Superintendent in this<br>

      <p class="s_default">Sir</p>
      <p class="s_default">I hope you will excuse my liberty<br>
        in writing to you but when you hear the manner<br>
        in which I have been treated fuller particulars of <br>
        which I am ready &amp; willing to prove I am satis<br>
        -fied I shall meet redress at your hands.<br>
        On Friday last I was at my house No 15 Sandys<br>
        Row Spitalfields, when Serjeant Alderman came<br>
        to my house &amp; said to me you have a stolen<br>
        copper there pointing to the one I had in front of the<br>
        Shop &amp; which I had from a Gentlemans house<br>
        as I can prove to you I said you have come to<br>
        the wrong shop &amp; I don't care for all the Officers<br>
        in London He said you are an impudent </p>
      <p class="s_default">(next page) </p>
      <p class="s_default">fellow &amp; because you are impudent I will take<br>
        you to the Station House and the Copper too<br>
        my Son and Brother who were present were <br>
        joking on the way to the Station House when<br>
        Alderman said dont you be so jolly I may <br>
        have a case yet When we came to the Police <br>
        Court Alderman swore that the copper was at<br>
        the back of the Shop inferring that it was<br>
        being concealed, when I declare by to God &amp; can <br>
        prove by numbers of people that the copper<br>
        was in the front of the Shop I omitted to<br>
        tell you that on the way to the Station <br>
        House my Son said you can convince him<br>
        where you got it when Alderman said<br>
        to me come along I'll learn you to be saucy to<br>
        me and it appears to me that was the crime<br>
        I was guilty of When we came to the Police<br>
        Court after hearing my explanation which<br>
        Alderman contemptuously had refused Mr<br>
        Bingham said I discharge this case and<br>
        turning to Alderman he said I am surprized<br>
        at you bringing a respectable man before me<br>
        on a charge of stealing a copper And now<br>
        Sir as if to add injury to insult I never got <br>
        my property returned till April 1st when<br>
        I was obliged to go and fetch it I have been<br>
        a respectable tradesman for upwards of 40<br>
        years. I have brought up a large Family in<br>
        credit &amp; respectability without ever having an<br>
        accusation of any kind brought against me<br>
        I am known to a large class of the 1st Upholsterers<br>
        in London &amp; I put it to you as a man &amp; a Gentle-<br>
        -man whether taking all the circumstances <br>
        together with the insulting behavior of one<br>
        of your men whether you do not think I have</p>
      <p class="s_default">been ill treated Waiting your early reply<br>
        I have the honour to subscribe myself<br>
