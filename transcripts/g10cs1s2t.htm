        for the disposal of stolen motor cars.<br>
        In the case of Harrington and others just concluded,<br>
        a large number of stolen motor cars had been successfully re-<br>
        registered and sold in the ordinary way of business.<br>
        Two methods were used by these persons; one was to<br>
        buy modern motor cars which had been involved in an accident and<br>
        were badly damaged. These cars, together with Registration<br>
        book, were purchased from insurance companies, at a very low<br>
        figure, as salvage. The cars were usually beyond repair, or <br>
        in such a state that repair could not be done on a profitable basis.<br>
        The salvage car was removed to a yard and broken up, <br>
        but the Registration Book was carefully preserved until a car of <br>
        similar make, and in every way identical with the smash car, could <br>
        be stolen. Having stolen a suitable car, the original numbers<br>
        were removed, and those from the Registration Book of the salvage <br>
        car, were substituted.<br>
        A Road Fund licence would then be obtained from the<br>
        Licensing authorities who would be under the impression that it<br>
        was to be applied to the car purchased from the Insurance<br>
        Company.</p>
