      <p class="s_default">FOR THE IDLE lad in his later teens the<br>
        corner of a street is even more dangerous than<br>
        the middle of a street for the aged and <br>
        preoccupied.<br>
        Here, in a hundred cities of England and Wales,<br>
        gather daily the men and lads who are already<br>
        unemployed and in danger of becoming unemploy-<br>
        able. Their desultory conversation hovers around<br>
        horses rather than football, and crime rather than <br>
        cricket.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        Five hundred lads each year are handed over by<br>
        the Courts of England and Wales to the care of the<br>
        Prison Commissioners, that they may receive this <br>
        Borstal training and grow to be decent men. A<br>
        fascinating task, but only to be attempted by the<br>
        optimist. Desires must be balanced and controlled,<br>
        and inhibition must be strengthened. The good <br>
        must be developed to beat the bad, and a clear and<br>
        effective knowledge of right and wrong introduced<br>
        into an impulsive system. What is this training,<br>
        based on what theory ; what ideal inspires it, in <br>
        what form does it operate? Nearly every vice<br>
        is represented in this straggling army. There is<br>
        scarcely a depth of depravity that one or other has <br>
        not probed in curious or precocious moments. Yet<br>
        strangely true is it also that every virtue is to be <br>
        found among them. One is loyal albeit dishonest,<br>
        another is truthful though of ungoverned temper, a<br>
        third picks pockets but loves music, a fourth main-<br>
        tains his honesty untarnished though he behaves<br>
        like a beast. In the great majority, moreover, there<br>
        is a social sense which enables them to follow a lead,<br>
        to respond to the appeal to support their small<br>
        community, particularly if it engages in friendly<br>
        competition with another small community. Borstal<br>
        training is based on the double assumption that<br>
        there is individual good in each, and among nearly<br>
        all an innate corporate spirit, which will respond to <br>
        the appeal made to the British of every sort to play<br>
        the game, to follow the flag, to stand by the old<br>
        ship.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default"> The first impression that a visitor receives is that<br>
        of rude health. Most of these lade were born in the<br>
        darkest homes and broke every law of health till they<br>
        came here. But now they traverse with cheery faces<br>
        and robust bodies a daily programme from 6.0 a.m.<br>
        to 9.0 p.m. Four simple but abundant meals, cost-<br>
        ing the taxpayer barely six shillings a week, regular<br>
        hours, hard work, and physical exercises are fitting <br>
        them for manhood. Every day they work in shop <br>
        or kitchen, on the farm or at unskilled labour, for<br>
        eight hours, broken only by dinner time.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(next page)<br>
        <br>
        Work and exercise and <br>
        education nearly fill the day. There follows a short<br>
        interval for recreation, when the intelligentsia play<br>
        chess and the proletariat argue about the Spurs.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> The purpose of a Borstal Institution is to teach<br>
        wayward lads to be self-contained men, to train them <br>
        to be fit for freedom. It is impossible to train men <br>
        for freedom in a condition of captivity.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> The task is<br>
        not to break or knead him into shape, but to stimu-<br>
        late some power within to regulate conduct aright,<br>
        to insinuate a preference for the good and the clean,<br>
        to make him want to use his life well, so that he<br>
        himself and not others will save him from waste.<br>
        <br>
        Further it requires that each lad shall <br>
        be dealt with as an individual and shall not be<br>
        regarded as being the same as any other lad, re-<br>
        quiring the same universal prescription.</p>
