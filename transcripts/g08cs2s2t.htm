      <p class="s_default">(i) INSTRUCTIONS respecting the DUTIES and POWERS of 
        CON-<br>
        STABLES, prepared for the Guidance of CONSTABLES appointed<br>
        under the Act of 2 and 3 VICT.c.93.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(side note in right margin accompanying paragraph below): 
        Directions for<br>
        Constables. Power<br>
        to arrest.</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        THE Constable may arrest one whom he has just cause to suspect to be about 
        to<br>
        commit a felony. Thus, when a drunken person or a man in a violent passion,<br>
        threatens the life of another, the Constable should interfere and arrest.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> He should arrest any person having in his possession 
        any picklock-key, crow,<br>
        jack, bit, or other implement with intent feloniously to break into any 
        dwelling-<br>
        house, warehouse, coach-house, stable or out-building, or any person armed 
        with<br>
        any gun, pistol, hanger, cutlass, bludgeon, or offensive weapon, or having 
        upon<br>
        him any instrument, with intent to commit any felonious act.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> Every person found in any dwelling-house, warehouse, 
        coach-house, out-house,<br>
        or stable, or in any inclosed yard, garden, or area, and being there for 
        any <br>
        unlawful purpose, may be arrested.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> In each of these cases the Constable must judge from 
        the situation and behaviour<br>
        of the party what his intention is. In some cases no doubt can exist, 
        as when the<br>
        party is a notorious thief, or acting with those who are thieves, or when 
        the party<br>
        is seen to try people's pockets in a crowd, or to attempt to break into 
        a house, or<br>
        to endeavour to take any property secretly from another. The Constable 
        will not<br>
        act hastily, in case the intention is not clear, but content himself with 
        watching<br>
        closely the suspected party, that he may discover his design.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        (ii) Though no charge be made, yet if the Constable suspect a person to 
        have<br>
        Committed a felony, he should arrest him, and if he have reasonable grounds 
        for</p>
      <p class="s_default">his suspicion, he will be justified, even though it 
        should afterwards appear that<br>
        no felony was in fact committed ; but the Constable must be cautious in 
        thus<br>
        acting upon his own suspicions.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> Generally, if the arrest was made discreetly and fairly, 
        in pursuit of an offender,<br>
        and not from any private malice or ill will, the Constable need not doubt 
        that the<br>
        law will protect him.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(iii) (side note in left margin accompanying paragraph 
        below): Power to require<br>
        persons to aid and <br>
        assist.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> If a Constable finds his exertions insufficient to 
        effect the arrest, he ought to<br>
        require all persons present to assist him, and they are bound to do so.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(iv) After arrest the Constable is, in all cases, to 
        treat a prisoner properly, and<br>
        impose only such constraint upon him as may be necessary for his safe 
        custody.</p>
      <p class="s_default">(next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default">(v) (side note in left margin accompanying paragraph 
        below): Power to apprehend<br>
        Prostitutes,<br>
        Vagrants, and<br>
        Disorderly Persons. </p>
      <p class="s_default"> The Constable has power to apprehend and carry before 
        a Justice of the Peace<br>
        every common prostitute wandering in the public streets, public highways, 
        or in<br>
        any place of public resort, behaving in a riotous or indecent manner ; 
        every<br>
        person wandering abroad, or placing himself or herself in any public street 
        or<br>
        highway, court or passage, to beg or gather alms, or causing, or procuring, 
        or encouraging any child so to do, all such being declared by the law 
        to be idle and <br>
        disorderly persons ; every person wandering abroad and lodging in any 
        barn or<br>
        out-house, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, 
        or under <br>
        a tent, or in any cart or waggon, not having any visible means of subsistence, 
        and <br>
        not giving a good account of himself or herself ; every person wandering 
        abroad<br>
        and endeavouring, by the exposure of wounds or deformities, to obtain 
        or gather<br>
        alms ; every person going about as a gatherer or collector of alms, or 
        endeavour-<br>
        ing to procure charitable contributions of any nature or kind under any 
        false or<br>
        fraudulent pretence ; every person playing or betting in any street, road, 
        high-<br>
        way, or other open or public place, at or with any table or instrument 
        of gaming<br>
        at any game or pretended game of chance.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> In the cases above mentioned the Constable has by 
        law power to arrest.</p>
