      <p class="s_default">The Case</p>
      <p class="s_default">Captain Pigram is commander of the custom Sloops Stationed 
        at the Port of Rye for the Guard of the / Eastern part of the Sea Coast 
        of this County and to prevent the exportation of Wool and Clandestinely 
        / importing Tea Brandy and other prohibited and uncustomed goods - The 
        11:th of August 1737. he sent out one of / his Vessells with Mr: Swaine 
        his Mate and about a dozen of his Mariners to Cruize along the Coast and 
        coming to / an Anchor pretty near the Shore of a place called Pevensey 
        Sluice about eight of the clock in the evening / Mr: Swaine sent James 
        Levereau (who has a a deputation from the commissioners of the customs) 
        and / Moses Longley Thomas Young John Carman and Michael Carosse four 
        of his Mariners in their Small / Boat to row along Shore to the Eastward 
        to intercept any Smuggling Vessells on the Coast - Ofof a place / called 
        Cowding pound in the parish of Bexhill about an hour after high water 
        they observed a Boat rowing / to the Shore from a Vessell - which lay 
        so very near the Shoar that she would have been dry at low water - / - 
        Levereau and his Men made directly after the other boat but assoon as 
        the persons in her perceived them / they made of again to their Vessell 
        and the other pursuing both boats came up to her side very near / togeather 
        and some of the Custom house Mariners saw them throw baggs out of the 
        boat into the / Vessell _ Levereau and the Mariners called out to them 
        told them who they were and called the / Prisoner by his name and told 
        him if they quietly Surrendred they Should be civilly used but the / Smugglers 
        being 12 or 15 in number swore they should not come on board the Vessell 
        and threw into the / Custom house boat large bowlder Stones which exceedingly 
        bruized and wounded the men and one / of the Smugglers fired a Pistol 
        into the boat loaded with Small Shott and one of the Shot corns went / 
        through Levereau's hat - notwithstanding this opposition Longley and Carman 
        got on board the Vessell and / Longley knock'd down one of the Smugglers 
        and saw lying on the deck about ten or twelve baggs of Tea which / they 
        believed was part of what had been thrown back from the Smuggling boat 
        and looking down into the hold / of the Vessell saw her wings and partitions 
        were full of Baggs of Tea which Smelled very strong - three of the / Gang 
        seized upon Longley and by violence threw him over board into the Sea 
        and afterwards attempted<br>
        to.</p>
      <p class="s_default"> (next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default">To Strike him in the Sea water with handspikes or long 
        Staves upon which Levereau begged that they / would forbear such barbarous 
        usage and Longly<br>
        was hawled out of the Sea into the boat - three more of the / Smugglers 
        likewise Seized upon Carman and Attempted to throw him into the Sea but 
        he luckily catched / hold of the Ships rigging and from that fell into 
        the Boat - Thomas Young Seeing Longley and / Carman had got on Board the 
        Smuggling Vessell took a Cutlash in his hand in order to do the same but 
        / one of the Smugglers with their boats mainyard knocked him down and 
        cutt him in the Scull that he lay / insensible a considerable time and 
        the Smugglers continuing to throw large Stones struck him with one of 
        them on the left side near his ear and others Struck him on his Arms by 
        which he was very much / bruized and it was thought he would have bled 
        to death with the wound in his head before the / bleeding could be Stopped 
        - the Custom Officers on this Violent opposition fired Several blunderbusses 
        / into the Vessel but being overpowered by numbers were obliged to quit 
        and return to their own / Vessell.</p>
