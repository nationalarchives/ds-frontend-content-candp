      <p>Carry out your own survey of attitudes to the police. A simple way of 
        doing this is to set up a number of statements. People have only to agree 
        or disagree with each one. <br>
        Here are a few statements to get you started:</p>
      <p>1. The police think that all young people are out to cause trouble.<br>
        2. If I was in trouble I would go to the police.<br>
        3. In the past the police knew how to handle young people.<br>
        4. The police are only doing their job.<br>
        5. The police make arrests so as to get promotion.<br>
        6. You should always try to help the police.</p>
      <p>Add three or four statements of your own. <br>
        All you have to do is add up the responses: someone who responds &quot;Agree&quot; 
        to numbers 1, 3 &amp; 5 and &quot;disagree&quot; to numbers 2, 4 and 6 
        is hostile to the police, and so on. <br>
        You would find it interesting to survey people from different age, class, 
        gender and ethnic groups and keep the results separate in order to compare 
        them.</p>
