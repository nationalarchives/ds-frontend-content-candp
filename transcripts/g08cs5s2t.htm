      <p class="s_default"> Francis Struty<br>
        Spitalfields<br>
        7th June 1848</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        Gentry,</p>
      <p class="s_default">Hearing from a variety of <br>
        Sources that the Police behaved with<br>
        unnecessary violence on Sunday Evening<br>
        last and being an unexpected spectator<br>
        of one of these affairs of riot I beg<br>
        to draw your attention to the following<br>
        facts. On Sunday evening I was proceeding<br>
        from Bethnal Green towards the Victoria<br>
        Park. I saw a tall man who I should judge<br>
        by his apparel was an Inspector passing<br>
        towards a Church I believe St James's<br>
        there were several hundred of persons<br>
        opposite throwing stones at the Windows<br>
        on the arrival of the officer a shout<br>
        was raised and words used such as <br>
        down with him so at this time every stone<br>
        was directed him - he was repeatedly</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        (next page)</p>
      <p class="s_default"><br>
        struck - Still he walked steadily and slowly,<br>
        indeed in my opinion too slowly to be<br>
        considered with discretion - he went into the<br>
        church and the attack recommenced at the <br>
        Windows. The officer then brought out his<br>
        Policemen and called on the mob to disperse<br>
        they were saluted with a complete volley<br>
        of stones he then said as near as I can<br>
        recollect &quot;forward my lads -- Steady&quot;<br>
        a most determined opposition to the Police<br>
        was made and hard blows were struck<br>
        on both sides the police dispersed the<br>
        populaces altho inferior in numbers<br>
        I am willing to bear testimony to<br>
        the coolness exercised by the Police and<br>
        especially to the conduct of the officer<br>
        and that no more than necessary violence<br>
        was used by the police on that occasion<br>
        to preserve the public peace</p>

        Your Obedient Servant <br>
