                  <p>Governments in Victorian Britain took a great interest in 
                    crime and in prison as a solution to crime. Prison was the 
                    means by which 90% of serious offenders were punished. There 
                    was considerable debate about how they were to be run and 
                    several systems were tried. </p>
                  <p>The Separate system. Under this system, based on Cherry Hill 
                    Prison in Pennsylvania, USA, prisoners were kept in solitary 
                    confinement, in order to think about their life and crimes. 
                    It was believed that they would then come face to face with 
                    the error of their ways. The Chaplain played an important 
                    part in this, encouraging them to turn to religion. Even when 
                    taking exercise, or in chapel, prisoners could not see, or 
                    talk to, each other. At Pentonville, a new prison opened in 
                    1842 under the separate system, several prisoners went mad 
                    and three committed suicide. </p>
                  <p>The Silent system. Under this system, based on Auburn Prison, 
                    New York, USA, prisoners could work, but monotonous and pointless 
                    work, in total silence. The work was:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Picking oakum (separating the strands of old ropes so 
                      that they could be used again - hence the saying &quot;money 
                      for old rope&quot;)</li>
                    <li>The treadmill, a large wheel on which prisoners walked, 
                      sometimes to drive a mill, sometimes just to create work.</li>
                    <li>The crank. This was a large handle in each cell, with 
                      a counter. The prisoner had to do so many thousand turns 
                      a day. (Warders could tighten up the crank, making it harder 
                      to turn: hence their nickname &quot;screws&quot;)</li>
                    <li> Shot drill (passing cannon-balls one to another along 
                      a line).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The point was to make the work hard and deliberately degrading: 
                    to break the prisoner's will and self-respect.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Hard bed, hard board, hard labour. In the last part of 
                      the 19th century, after the 1865 Prisons Act and under Assistant 
                      Director of Prisons Sir Edmund du Cane, prisons were made 
                      even tougher. Hard plank beds replaced hammocks, food was 
                      deliberately boring and inmates had to work hard on the 
                      monotonous, even pointless tasks described above.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To further bring prisons into line, they were all taken out 
                    of local control and put under the government, through the 
                    Home Office, in 1877. Old, small prisons were shut down. By 
                    this time the normal sentence was one year in solitary confinement, 
                    followed by three years hard labour. Even time off for good 
                    behaviour was stopped. Corporal punishment, whipping, continued. 
                    By the turn of the century, however, some people were saying 
                    that this kind of regime was inhumane.</p>
                  <p>Hangings, no longer held in public after 1868, were carried 
                    out in prison.</p>
