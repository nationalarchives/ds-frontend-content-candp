      <p> VI. William Dabell, Condemned for breaking open the<br>
        House of Mr. Thomas Plastel, both on the 17th and on the<br>
        31st of October last. He said he was 18 years of Age, born in<br>
        the Parish of St. Andrews Holbourn, and that he had been <br>
        well bought up by his Parents, by whose Religious Care<br>
        he had receiv'd very good Instruction, and been made ac-<br>
        quainted with what a Christian ought both to know and<br>
        to practice : But he was tempted and yielded to the<br>
        Temptation of the Devil, by whose only instigation it was<br>
        that he went about to rob the House of Mr. Plastel ;<br>
        which, he said, was the first ill thing of this nature<br>
        he ever did. As he as not so old an Offender as the others<br>
        were, so he appear'd to be much better than they, diposed<br>
        to Repentance. He pray'd very earnestly, and was very<br>
        devout ; and shew'd great Sorrow for his Offences against<br>
        God and his Neighbour. He begg'd Pardon of both ; and <br>
        declared that he dy'd in Charity with all Mankind, and hop'd<br>
        to be saved through the alone Merits of his Redeemer.<br>
        This Day they were all carry'd in two Carts to Tyburn,<br>
        where I discharg'd my Ministerial Office to them for the last<br>
        time ; exhorting them further to clear their Consciences,<br>
        and</p>
      <p> (next page)</p>
      <p>and lift up their Hearts to God, I ask'd them whether they<br>
        had any thing more to say for the Satisfaction of the World,<br>
        the Ease of their own Minds.</p>
