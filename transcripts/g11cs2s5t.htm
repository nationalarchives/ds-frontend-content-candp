        Case History<br>
        An 11 year old boy<br>
        complained that he had been<br>
        assaulted by a police officer during<br>
        an interview at a primary school.<br>
        The officer admitted slapping<br>
        the child but claimed to have been<br>
        provoked by his abusive remarks.<br>
        The force proposed that the<br>
        officer be formally admonished.<br>
        However, the Authority decided to<br>
        recommend a disciplinary charge<br>
        of abuse of authority. This was<br>
        accepted and the officer pleaded<br>
        guilty. He was fined &pound;500.</p>
      <p><br>
        (ii)<br>
        Case History<br>
        Mr S made a complaint and a <br>
        civil claim against police for <br>
        unlawful arrest and assault.<br>
        Following an anonymous <br>
        telephone call alleging that he<br>
        had a gun in his car, Mr S had<br>
        been arrested by armed officers.<br>
        He resisted and had to be <br>
        restrained. He claimed that his<br>
        wrist had been broken and arrived<br>
        to make his complaint with his<br>
        arm in plaster.<br>
        During the investigation <br>
        further anonymous telephone<br>
        calls were received and it became<br>
        clear that these had been made by<br>
        Mr S himself. It was also <br>
        confirmed that Mr. S had not <br>
        suffered any injury but had tricked<br>
        a nurse into applying the plaster<br>
        cast to his wrist.<br>
        Mr S admitted to engineering<br>
        the whole incident in an attempt<br>
        to obtain substantial damages. He<br>
        was charged with deception and<br>
        wasting police time. He apologised and formally withdrew his complaint.</p>
