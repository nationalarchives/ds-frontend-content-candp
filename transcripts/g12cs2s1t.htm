      <p class="s_default">Development of Principles of Training
        3. Since 1895 therefore the basic problem of prison administration
        had been to devise methods of treating prisoners which on the one 
        hand will 'effectually&#133;turn them out of prison better men and
        women&#133;than when they came in', and in the other can be reconciled
        with the facts that the prisoner has been sent to prison as a punishment
        for an offence, and that one purpose of punishment is to deter both
        that offender and all potential offenders from committing further
        offences of that sort. The reconciliation in one system of principles 
        so
        apparently opposed as deterrence and reform, punishment and re-
        habilitation, was not and could not be simple.
